## 👤 About
Hey everyone! I am originally from Rochester, NY & graduated from Brockport High School. I enlisted in the Navy in 2017 as an Operations Specialist. I spent 3 years abroad in Rota, Spain. This experience heavily shaped me as it forced me out of my comfort zone. I made hundreds of friends and gained valuble experience with computer systems. However, I also made hundreds of mistakes, which I am also extremely grateful for as it has molded me into a better human. I have lived in Florida since 2021, and will be leaving the Navy in 2026.
